# User Defined Functions
Programming with User Defined Functions

## Description
For this task I was asked to calculate a users total holiday cost.
This included plane, hotel and car rental cost.

To do this I created some options for the user then got their input.
I asked them how many nights they will be staying at a hotel.
Then I got them to input the number of days they would need a car hire.

Next I created functions starting with Hotel cost, which took the number of nights as an argument
then returned the cost for the hotel stay.

The next function was for plane cost which took the city flight as an argument and returned the cost for the flight.
using an if block to determine chosen city.

The car rental function took rental days as an argument and returned the cost of the car rental.

finally Holiday cost function took all three prior arguments to add the costs and return a total holiday cost.

The information is then printed back to the user in a readable manner.

## Project Usage
This repository exists to showcase my ability to work with user defined functions. It was created as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp.
